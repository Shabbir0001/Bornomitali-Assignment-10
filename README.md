# Welcome To Bornomitali
## Check the live site here-  https://bornomitali.web.app

I have made the frontend of the site with ReactJs and some necessary tools, In the backend I have used ExpressJs, MongoDB, NodeJs.
The frontend deployed in Firebase, I also used Firebase authentication in the logIn section. 
The backend deployed in Heroku.

You will explore Bornomitali as a simple e-commerce website. Except payment methode the site is complete to take any order and manage the data of products, users and admins. You can browse the shop in the homepage, place order, add/remove/update product information in the admin page. User can find his orders in the Your Order button. I have secured the admin page with javascript ternary operation. For now the key is "OPEN". use it to explore the admin page.

I have tried to make some animated effect using plain CSS.

In this assignment I have faced less errors than other 9 assignment.
